    <h1>Welcome to Harry Potter info page</h1>
    <p class="cursive">Harry James Potter is a fictional character and the titular protagonist in J. K. Rowling's series of eponymous novels.
         The majority of the books' plot covers seven years in the life of the orphan Harry, who, on his eleventh birthday, 
         learns he is a wizard. Thus, he attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to practise magic under the guidance 
         of the kindly headmaster Albus Dumbledore and other school professors along with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. 
         Harry also discovers that he is already famous throughout the novel's magical community,
          and that his fate is tied with that of Lord Voldemort â€“ the internationally feared Dark Wizard and murderer of his parents,
           Lily and James. The book and film series revolve around Harry's struggle to adapt to the wizarding world and defeat Voldemort.
