            <q>Everybody knows electrical is higher in the engineering pecking order than CS because it requires real math ;-) I'm a rocket scientist, though, not a very good one</q>

            <h3>Short Bio:</h3>
            <p>Terry Davis was born Terrence Andrew Davis. He was born in West Allis, Wisconsin on December 15, 1969. Since elementary school, Terry had a knack for technology. That is where he first started to use the Apple II. Later, in high school he would learned how to program in assembly on a Commodore 64. Using the Commodore 64 would become his inspiration for the Operating System he would later create called LoseThose (later becoming TempleOS).</p>

            <p>Sadly, for much of Terry's adult life, he would be in and out of psychiatric facilities. The more his mental health would decline, the more he would have ‘revelations’ from God. He believed himself to be ‘God’s chosen programmer’. This would later become the inspiration for naming his OS TempleOS. </p>
                
            <p>Terry would post about his OS on sites like Reddit. He would also start doing livestreams on YouTube. Before he passed away, Terry would go through periods of being homeless and in and out of incarceration. On August 11, 2018, Terry was walking alongside a railroad track in The Dalles, Oregon and subsequently truck and killed by an oncoming train.</p>            
            
            <h3>Career:</h3>
            <p>It is unclear as to where Terry worked. The only known place of employement for Terry was at Ticketmaster from 1990 to 1996.  </p>
            <h3>Mental Health & Controversy</h3>
            <p>Due to his Schizophrenia, Terry would go through episodes of racial tirades. As it turns out, because of his lack of ability to communitcate, he was seen as crazy bigot and no one took him seriously.</p>
            <h3>TempleOS:</h3>
            <p>Around 2004 and 2005 Terry started to work on a project he at the time called LoseThos. This project would later be know as TempleOS. Inspired by the Commedore 64 DOS style interface, he sought to recreate it. </p>
            <p>Terry would go on to creater his own programming language called Holy C, to compile the OS. He would also render it with 640x480 and 16-color display with a single audio voice. He believed that is what God instructed him to do.</p>
