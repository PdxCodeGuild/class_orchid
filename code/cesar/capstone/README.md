# Log Runner

### PDX Code Guild Capstone | Cesar Rebolledo

## Project Overview
The purpose of this website is to create a community of ultra 
marathon runners and trail runner alike. I would like to integrate
the Strava API which will allow users to connect their runs to the
website. 

I would also like to if possible, use another API that can connect
to other websites that can pull out information about up coming 
ultra marathon races. 

It will be a community oriented website that will encourage engagment
through likes, comments, and uploading pictures of your run.

## Features
- User registration 
- User authentication
- User connection with Strava API to allow people to share their runs
- User ability to upload pictures of their runs and possible geotag.
- User ability to make comments on the runs.

- Ability to share a location where everyone can meet up in person 
for a safer run
