            </h2>
                <p>Mom always taught us to curl up in a ball and remain motionless when confronted. We need a name. Maybe 'Operation Hot Mother'. No, Pop-pop does not get a treat, I just brought you a [bleep]ing pizza. Yo quiero leche. Yo quiero leche de madre. You burn down the storage unit? Oh, most definitely. So Ann, the question is, do you want a man or a boy? I know how I would answer. Well excuse me, Judge Reinhold.</p>

                <p>Oh…yeah…the guy in the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on! If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. I don't care for Gob. Everything they do is so dramatic and flamboyant. It just makes me want to set myself on fire.</p>

                <p>I'm going to buy you the single healthiest call girl this town has ever seen. Oh, I can just taste those meaty leading man parts in my mouth. Say something that will terrify me. Lindsay: F*** me. Tobias: No, that didn't do it. Family Love Michael. Yeah, like I'm going to take a whiz through this $5,000 suit.</p>

                <p id="last">I'm tired of trying to find happiness through lies and self-medicating. If you need me, I'll be at the bar. It's OUR nausea. No, I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. I prematurely shot my wad on what was supposed to be a dry run.</p>
