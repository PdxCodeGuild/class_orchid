The Plan:

Basic NASA images search and favorite website. Users be able to login and browse randomly provided/keyword indexed space images from NASA
and save them to their profile. The main page will display a loop of 10 random favorited images from users prior and the profile pages
will use another carousel to display previously favorited images. Bootstrap is something I have not been able to successfully utlize in any project
and I really like the design of the Carousel model. I want to make primary use of this bootstrap wherever possible.

Actually I don't know anymore.
