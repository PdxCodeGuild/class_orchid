                        <h1>What</h1>
                        <p>We raise the rare Blanc de Hotot rabbit. It is recognized as a rare breed by both the
                            American Rabbit
                            Breeders Association and the Livestock Conservancy. We raise Ancona ducks, a US
                            based
                            breed
                            recognized as
                            threatened by the Livestock Conservancy. We also raise Rex rabbits and a variety of
                            chickens. We recently
                            introduced Ayam Cemani chicks to the farm. We're hoping to be able to hatch them out
                            next
                            year.</p>
                        <h1>Why</h1>
                        <p>Recently our food supply has undergone some challenges not seen in many decades.
                            Additionally, the
                            quality of life of commercial livestock is often compromised for the sake of increased
                            productivity. At
                            Green Herb we strive to give all animals in our care the most humane life experince
                            possible.</p><br>

                    <h2>Green Herb Rabbitry is a small homestead dedicated to the preservation of rare breeds of
                        small
                        livestock.
                        Located in central North Carolina, the animals are bred for their tolerance to heat and
                        humidity
                        as well
                        as
                        exemplifying their breed standard.</h2>

                        <h1>How</h1>
                        <p>All animals are given the best possible care in accordance with their species.
                            Not all
                            species appreciate
                            attention but those that do are handled from day one. Feed and enrichment
                            opportunities
                            are
                            also chosen
                            with care. The on-site garden is mostly for the benefit of the animals growing
                            seasonal
                            tomatoes, kale and
                            wheat grass, among other things. </p>
