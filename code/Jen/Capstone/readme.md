# **Green Herb Rabbitry**

#### PDX CodeGuild Capstone Project by Jennifer Williams
--- Find out what Green Herb Rabbitry is up to all in one location
## Project Outline
This is a website for Green Herb Rabbitry. It will display the breeding rabbits, upcoming litters, rabbits for sale and information on upcoming shows. Admins will be able to add and change information. Users will be able to log in and choose to get updates on litters or add information about rabbits that came from Green Herb Rabbitry. 
This website is intended to become the business website at the already purchased domain www.greenherbrabbitry.com. It will be the main source of interaction between my business and other breeders. My intent is to take advantage of bootstratp for an enhanced user experience as well as Vue for organization of information, built on Django to put it all together.

## Features

#### Primary Features
- Users are able to submit thier interest and contact information.
- Users are able to submit photos of their rabbits from Green Herb Rabbitry, after logged in, to one page only
- Admincan remove all pictures, including user pictures
- Critical info about a rabbit will be displayed under the photos. Selecting a rabbit's photo will show some of the lineage of that rabbit.

#### User Stories

- "As a user I want to be able to see what shows Green Herb Rabbitry will be at so that I can see how the judges evaluate their rabbits."
- "As an admin I want to be able to delete user submissions in case they are inappropriate."
